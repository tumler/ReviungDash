The REVIUNGDASH47 is 47/8 key column staggered keyboard. Inspired by the Reviung41
(& ERGODASH) hence the name!

Differences between the REVIUNG41:

* Addition of 6 corner keys
* Spacebar can be either a single switch or have 2x 1u switches
(inspired by the Ergodash which allows choosing the thumb keys)
* The RGB led on the front was rerouted to be first (as I would rather have 1
led and don't use the underglow - this allows to not have to solder all the other
leds but they can be if wanted later)
