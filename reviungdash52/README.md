The REVIUNGDASH52 is a 52 key column staggered keyboard. Based on the
REVIUNGDASH47 but with a larger thumb cluster.

The REVIUNGDASH47 is 47/8 key column staggered keyboard. Inspired by the Reviung41
(& ERGODASH) hence the name!

Differences between the REVIUNGDASH47:

* Addition of a thumb cluster - inspired by the Ergodash cluster
    * 2 Extra thumb keys each side
* Left / Right sides further apart to accomodate thumb cluster, while remaining
as close as possible to remain small yet comfortable
* Every layer designed as PCBs (could easily be swapped out for acrylic / metal layers)
